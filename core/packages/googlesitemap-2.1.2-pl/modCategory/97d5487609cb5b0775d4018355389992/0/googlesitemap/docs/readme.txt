Snippet: GoogleSiteMap
--------------------
Version: 2.1.x
First Relesed: Feb 8, 2018
Author: YJ Tso <yj@modx.com>, Garry Nutting <garry@modx.com>

- Added cachemanager plugin OnSiteRefresh
- Complete rewrite based on Garry's blazing fast sitemap code
- Added cachemanager
- Efforts were made to make it backwards compatible using runSnippet to call the legacy snippet if legacy features are required.

Examples:
[[!GoogleSiteMap]] // Will output a sitemap many times faster than the legacy Snippet
[[!GoogleSiteMap? &itemTpl=`gItem`]] // &itemTpl is a legacy feature, so the legacy Snippet will be called. No performance benefit, except new caching mechanism.
