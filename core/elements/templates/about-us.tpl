                  1984, Dream Home moved to Cabinet Way, Chingford, where it
                  established a small kitchen assembly facility, and in 1992,
                  Kevin and Chris took the opportunity to purchase the company,
                  keen to expand into manufacturing. They were aware of the
                  skilled craftsmanship that went into creating premium
                  kitchens, thanks to their many years importing products from
                  some of the most renowned German and Italian manufacturers.
                  They coupled this knowledge with their experience of the UK
                  market to develop their own high-quality product.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Despite starting from humble beginnings, with only a handful
                  of key staff, the business successfully designed and
                  manufactured its own quality kitchens and the company’s
                  reputation grew. In 1999 Kevin and Chris decided to rebrand
                  and introduce the name Urban Myth, as a reflection of the
                  company’s innovation and modernity, to carry the company into
                  the 21st Century.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Over the years, Urban Myth has continued to develop and expand
                  its own manufactured product range ‘Urban Life’, whilst
                  maintaining excellent relationships with its German and
                  Italian kitchen manufacturers to offer customers one of the
                  most diverse ranges of kitchens available.
